# Paint-for-kids
A GUI paint program for kids
A fancy colorful application is an effective way to teach kids some computer skills.
Educational games are another enjoyable way for kids teaching. In this project (Paint for Kids) we
build a simple application that enables kids draw fancy shapes and also play some
simple games with those shapes. this application should help a kid draw a number of figures, fill
them with different colors, save and load a graph, and so on. The application provide a
game playing mode to teach kids how to differentiate between figuresâ€™ types and colors.
The application supports 2 modes: draw mode and play mode. Each mode contains 2
bars: tool bar that contains the main operations of the current mode and status bar that contains
any messages the application will print to the kid.
